- Currently, we use MySQL WEEKDAYS() for key operations.
This means that we MUST follow the WEEKDAYS specification:
"MySQL WEEKDAY() returns the index of the day in a week for 
a given date (0 for Monday, 1 for Tuesday and ......6 for Sunday)."

- very complicated bug. when changing a meal option and then changing it again,
and then changing it again to the original selection, it did not work (basically,
"combo-box" variables where not updated accordingly.
---- FIX: no more "combo box" variables: when needed, the database is looked again.

- very stupid bug. pass an argument as a parameter that you want to "change" ... but
you assigned the parameter to ato a NEW object... that's it!
